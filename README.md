# blog.php
Short and simple blog system written in PHP.  
BEFORE YOU INSTALL: This is only for my personal website. If you really plan to deploy this yourself, you'll need to change a lot of stuff unless your name is Ian Hiew.  
# Installation  
-  `git clone https://github.com/pixdoet/blog.php.git`  
-  Move files to somewhere in the server.  
You're done! Now you can start the blog and it should work now!
